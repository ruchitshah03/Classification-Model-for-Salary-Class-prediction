# Classification-Model-for-Salary-Class-prediction

Implementation of the Machine learning supervised model for the prediction of the salary for the Kaggle Data Scientist survey. 

• Cleaned the data to remove missing values and performed label encoding and one-hot encoded wherever suitable.
• Correlation plot and random forest classifier are compared for feature selection with PCA for dimensionality reduction.
• Implemented ordinal logistic regression model with 10-fold cross validation with Grid Search hyperparameter tuning.
• Predicted the result for the salary bucket with an accuracy score on test data of 42.743%.
